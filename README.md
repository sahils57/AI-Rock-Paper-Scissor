Visit the URL above. I quote from the paper:
A truly random game of rock-paper-scissors would result in a statistical tie
with each player winning, tying and losing one-third of the time. However,
people are not truly random and thus can be studied and analyzed. While this
computer won't win all rounds, over time it can exploit a person's tendencies
and patterns to gain an advantage over its opponent.
Now play the game of the rock-paper-scissors against the computer at least 100 times while
you record the outcome (your moves & the computer's move) at each time into a textle.
Record the score at the bottom of thele, i.e. your number of wins, losses and ties out
of N tries (N  100). Now use thisle to come up with some algorithm that takes as
input the history to how the game has been played and estimate your best move for the
next round. Put this algorithm into a simple program (use Java, Matlab, python, C, etc.,
or whatever you like) and play the computer again at least the same number of times you
played before, but this time using your program. Record the score (hopefully there is an
improvement in your score!!).

The way I chose to solve this, is by playing with the computer a few times and understand what the computer is trying to learn.
Once I figured out what sort of patterns the computer is looking for. Then I wrote my program to find the same patterns in my play and
predict my move just as the opposition computer is doing and then play move that would counter the "counter of computer"
